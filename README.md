# showTracker

This is my first project with Angular

It's a work in progress, from an example taken from the Internet, to a full App that uses AngularJS, Express & NodeJS.

I know nothing about these technologies, but I am learning while I create the project.

It's meant to be the first item in my portfolio, to find an AngularJS related job.
