# showTracker

This is my first "experiment" with Angular

It's a work in progress, right now not making much sense.

I use this project basically to learn. Right now it's just a bunch of code lines that don't make much sense. I am shaping it a bit every day.

# Installation (if you really want to)

Clone this repo

Then cd into the "client" folder and execute:

npm install grunt
npm install
bower install

Finally, cd into "server" and execute these commands:

npm install
