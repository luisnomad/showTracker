# showTracker

This is my first project with Angular

It's a work in progress, from an example taken from the Internet, to a full App that uses AngularJS, Express & NodeJS.

I know nothing about these technologies, but I am learning while I create the project. Right now it's just a bunch of code lines that don't make much sense. I am shaping it a bit every day.

# Installation

Clone this repo

Then cd into the "client" folder and execute:

npm install grunt
npm install
bower install

Finally, cd into "server" and execute these commands:

npm install
